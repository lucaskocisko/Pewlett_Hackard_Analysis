# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

The purpose of this challenge is to find the number of employees about to retire. I made a query to find people born at the company born bewtween January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Then filtered to show the currently employed people, a list of soon to be retirees and their titles gives an idea of the impact on the company. The result needed further filtering using the DISTINCT ON fuction to condense data from people who changed positions within. The SECOND deliverable shows employees who could serve as mentors. By changing the birth date in the query, we can see the senior positions of the company.
